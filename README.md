# Rubik
Rubik's Cube in pygame with OpenGL

The script show on the screen a Rubik Cube buit 
with OpenGL.

Then I have also implemented all the possible moves as 
combination of the main moves.

It is possible to change camera view with te mnouse
in a way rude.

Next step is to build an AI to solve it automatically.

Feel free to download and edit it for your purpouse.

See you soon.
